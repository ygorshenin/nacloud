This is simple project about auctions in high-science fields.

There are many types of auctions in high-science fields, but this project
is focused on AUSM (Adaptive User Selection Mechanism) auction type,
which is used in NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

AUSM model (with queue):
	-- There are n demanders and m suppliers;
	
	-- Suppliers supplies goods (one good from each supplier) with d dimensions each
	(for instance, cluster with fixed amount of CPU, RAM, HDD and so on);
	
	-- Quantities of dimensions may differs from one good to another;
	
	-- Each supplier may impose basic costs on one unit of each dimension, minumum costs,
	at which he is ready to sell his good;
	
	-- Auction runs in several rounds (auction stops after some limit of rounds,
	   or when there are no changes after some round);

	-- There are potential allocation of goods among demanders after each round;
	
	-- Everybody knows all bids and potential allocations on previous rounds (queue, known to all);

	-- On each round every demander may offer bid (if his previous bid was rejected).
	A bid represends requirements (list of quantities of dimensions), id of supplier,
	which part of good demander wants buy, and amount of money, which he is willing to pay.
	More formally, bid is < d (vector of requirements), f (id of supplier), b (amount of money) >.
	If there are enough "free space" in good, bid is accepted.
	Otherwise, a bid replaces a contract (or group of contracts) in potential allocation if and only if
	b is higher than the sum of the bids, offered by those being replaced. If so, all replaced bids rejected.

	In any case, this bid and new potential allocation pushed into queue.
